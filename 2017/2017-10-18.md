- "plan to steal the ship and navigate it to Peru, where they will sell the cargo and vessel and disappear with the money"
- " feels he has no other way to escape poverty, is left alone to manage the ship and three native crew members, despite having no seafaring experience."

- sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered
thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland
- Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following trade winds
- As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. It is this factor that drove sailing ships aside.
- When traveling on a freighter ship you are essentially paying for many days and nights of food and accommodation in addition to the transportation.
- Freighters haul at a breakneck pace across the open ocean, often through storm
- Most freighter ships follow well-defined shipping routes and make stops at the large port cities (Long Beach, Oakland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kaohsiung, etc.).
- As a passenger you eat with the officers
- Some of the ports are HUGE, as in miles across...a seemingly endless maze of containers stacked four stories high. If you go onshore alone, it is much easier to get out of the port than it is to come back to the port to re-board.

# Direction

direct instructions about an action that the player ought to take

# Allusion

a kind of puzzle that the player needs to figure out by investigating

NPC allusions rule: the number of NPCs in a single town/area who provide allusions on the same topic is inversely proportional to the proximity in space and time of the alluded object. Or, in other words, if a bunch of people are talking about the same vague thing in a town, expect that thing

# Condition

NPC statements about the status of the level of interactivity of a gameplay element
- do not indicate any possibility for direct player action to change the condition, or else it's an allusion or direction.
- Satisfaction of the condition is often undisclosed: the game tells the player to "go do something else, and come back when the condition is changed, as a consequence of your actions elsewhere."


# Reactions

## Situational
reactions to game states that the player characters also endure,
## Attributive
an NPC reacts to your direct agency with knowledge that you've done it. 

# Expansions

an event expansion must be about an event in which the player played no role, AND (important!) which the player does not endure
