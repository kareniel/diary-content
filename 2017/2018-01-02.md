## Dropbox syncing statuses

#### Green icon with check mark	
###### Synced
A green circle with a check mark is a wonderful thing and what you'll see most often. When it appears on an individual file or folder, it means the file or folder has finished syncing the latest changes.

#### Blue icon with rotating arrows	
###### Sync in progress
The blue circle with rotating arrows is another great sign that your Dropbox is running smoothly. Individual files and folders that are in the process of syncing will also appear with this icon.

#### Gray icon with a minus sign	
###### A file or folder isn't syncing
The gray circle with the minus sign may appear on a file or folder when you're using the Selective Sync feature (meaning you've opted not to sync it on your computer). In general selectively synced files and folders won't appear in your Dropbox at all. However, if you create a new file or folder with the same name, it will appear with the gray icon, indicating that it's not being synced.

#### Red icon with an x	
###### Sync not happening
The red circle with the x means that something is wrong, and Dropbox is unable to sync. Usually, this happens because your storage quota is full (can't upload), your hard drive is full (can't download), or you're experiencing connection problems (no Internet). See our troubleshooting page if this icon appears.
