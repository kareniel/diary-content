### [Montreal] Theravada Forest Tradition Meetup

**Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma-sambuddhassa.**


This is an initiative to gather lay buddhist practioners living on the island of Montreal. 

Join us if you are interested in:
- studying the suttas
- meditating together weekly
- chanting
- organizing short meditation retreats
- carpooling to monasteries

We have taken the three gems as our shelter and guiding ideal:
  1. The Buddha, the rediscoverer of liberation from human suffering; 
  2. The Dhamma, the way to that liberation; and 
  3. the Sangha, those who practiced that way and have discovered liberation for themselves.

To the best of our abilities, we try to:
- practice generosity
- support monks and nuns who adhere to the monastic code
- follow the five precepts
- practice the observance day (taking the 8 precepts once a week)
- nurture wholesome qualities inside ourselves
- train our mind with meditation
