> Let's say you're popular enough on the internet to entertain the idea of running an email newsletter, but too busy to deal with the requisite curation of content.

> With its twee name and Etsy-fied graphic design (the “i” in “TinyLetter” is sometimes dotted with a heart), it’s more of a small-batch brew tailored to the creative class, particularly those seeking to hone their prose skills in a semipublic forum.
