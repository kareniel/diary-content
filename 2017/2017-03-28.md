Jasper Morrison and the notion of Super Normal

terminal fonts:

- monospaced: assignment operators nicely line up and make aligning code easier
- clear and readable: clear letters, with easily distinguishable punctuation and between certain common characters
- unicode: to display almost characters with any languages

> Attentiveness turns the normal artful

> There are better ways to design than putting a lot of effort into making something look special. Special is generally less useful than normal, and less rewarding in the long term. Special things demand attention for the wrong reasons, interrupting potentially good atmosphere with their awkward presence.

> The consistency of normalcy improves the experience of living with the objects, because the longer we spend in contact with the products of design, the more their willful attempts at individualism irritate us.
