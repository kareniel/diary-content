In between the field notes, some thoughts, some reflections.
Spent a few hours moving around, thinking about movement.

I haven't been going to the gym, because it didn't feel right anymore. Knowing that I still need to care for the health of this body, I've been looking for an alternative. I think I might have found it tonight in the form of a regular practice of mobility exercises. 

There's two main goals I have with physical training: good posture and freedom of movement.
