- googled: `electronics basics`
- started reading [Basic Electronics by randofo](http://www.instructables.com/id/Basic-Electronics/)
- reading through it i found the following quote:
  >Â "Shorts are bad because they will result in your battery and/or circuit overheating, breaking, catching on fire, and/or exploding."
- that lead me to consider `security` as an important topic to cover.
- googled: `getting started with electronics`
- scavenging!
  - desktop computer power supplies
  - speakers
  - old fan

# writing more

1. Give yourself permission to write shitty first drafts.
2. Think of writing as cooking and growing.
3. The idea that you first try to capture may not be be the real subject, so be prepared to let that triggering subject go later.
