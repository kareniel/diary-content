I've been meaning to write more on my blog but I keep finding all these excuses. I guess I'm scared that if it's not polished enough, it's gonna hurt my reputation or something.  However, I find it super easy to jot down notes in this diary. So what I think I can do is simply expand on my notes here. I can grow them organically. No pressure, just notes about notes. With links and such. I'm sort of hoping to see some patterns emerge and then I can prune them like a bonsai tree.  
Let's see where this goes!

### Quotes

> In many respects, the dog house is a perfect project for the enthusiastic novice. Itâ€™s grand enough to be inspiring, but humble enough to preclude a sense of crushing defeat if the child happens to screw it up or lose interest halfway through.

I've been thinking about how it's so easy for me to start projects and how I never really care about finishing them. I used to think it was a problem, but I'm pretty at peace with that now. Yet I think it might still be a good idea to figure out how to finish them, because then I can share my work with the world more easily. So I thought "What I started specing out my projects and gave myself a time frame?". I found this quote tonight, and I feel like it fits in this train of thought.
