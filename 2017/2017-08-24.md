chaos and order

we want tiranny because we despise what we don't know
or want anarchy because we refuse responsibility

too much order makes collapse into chaos even more likely
too much chaos calls the devils of totalitarianism

meaning

we detect it with our being
it should guide our intellect

balanced
secure and confident,
but challenged enough to be alert and developing

well nurtured meaning produce love for life, and gratitude
so deep that the terrible limitations of being are justified

overwhelmed, hopeless, bitter, vengeful, cruel
willfully blind, narrow, bored, cynical, vicious
angry at the dreadful, limited conditions of existence

"to hell with it"
hell is where they're headed, where they'd like to drag everyone else 
they want revenge against the conditions of being

how might a person live in reality?

watch yourself
as if you're someone you know very little about
see when you are where you should be psychologically

practice spending more time in the place where you want to be
do whatever you have to do to stay there

given disciplined effort
you will be in the proper place more often
