> traditional economics sees work as a sacrifice of our time, our leasure and our comfort
and wages as a compensation for that sacrifice

to do well means:
- give and receive love
- enjoy the respect of our peers
- to contribute useful work
- to feel secure
- to have a sense of belonging and trust in our community
- to participate meaningfully in the life of society
