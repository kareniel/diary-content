## upgrading ubuntu

10.04 LTS → 12.04 LTS → 14.04 LTS → 16.04 LTS
lucid → precise → trusty → xenial

make sure repos are set properly
`etc/apt/sources.list`

replaces urls in sources from `archive` and `security` to `old-releases` if necessary
also, double check to make sure there wasn't a location name in front of the url (ie: us.archive)

`sudo sed -i -e 's/archive.ubuntu.com\|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list`

make sure update-manager-core is present 
`sudo apt-get install update-manager-core`

check currently installed version

`lsb_release -a`

stop non-critical services

`service apache2 stop`
`service mongod stop`

---

for lucid to precise:

create `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.d/unauth.cfg`
and add the following: (**MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE FILE AFTER**)

```
[Distro]
AllowUnauthenticated=yes
```

---


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo do-release-upgrade
```
