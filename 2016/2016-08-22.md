## developer development

- build efficiency *(performing a given task in the most economical manner possible)*, and 
  spend some of the time saved on healthy habits (exercise, time with loved ones, relaxing, etc)
  
- share your work *daily* in some form or another (ship early and often)

## CI server tasks

- monitors the repository and checks out changes when they occur
- builds the system and runs unit and integration tests
- releases deployable artefacts for testing
- assigns a build label to the version of the code it just built
- informs the team of the successful build or if the build or tests fails
