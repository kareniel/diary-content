## nodejs clustering

*"application-level scaling"*

Run `cluster.fork()` for as many cores the machine has, if the `cluster.isMaster`
When a worker is forked off of the main process, it re-runs the code from the beginning of the module.
So just `http.createServer()` each time and have all of them listen to the same port.
The master process will redistribute the requests so they can all be handle in parallel.

Make sure you revive your workers when they die:
```javascript
cluster.on('online', (worker) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} is online`)
});

cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died with code: ${code}, and signal: ${signal}`)
    console.log(`Starting a new worker`)
    cluster.fork()
})
```
