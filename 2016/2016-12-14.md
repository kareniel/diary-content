# Commons based peer production (CBPP)


a new mode of production, alternative to markets and networks

1. decentralization: 
    the authority to act resides with individual agents faced with opportunities for action, rather than in the hands of a central organizer, like the manager of a firm or a bureaucrat

2. a frequent use of common resources and public good:
    make use of shared resources, mostly immaterial as in the case of Open Software or other knowledge commons, but sometimes also material resources as in the case of Fab Labs, where machinery and other resources are shared among members, or within the ‘Sharing Economy’ more generally

    what members make out of such common resources is itself made common, put back into the commons pool

3. the prevalence of non-monetary motivations:
    1. the pleasure or satisfaction of giving - generosity, kindness, benevolence
    2. reputation 
        - can be institutionalized in explicit metrics, or simply implicitly recognized.
        - valuable as a measure of the overall risk that a person poses in relation to the realization of a future project (a measure of virtue)
        - mirrors peer estimations of an individuals ability to live virtuously according to the ethos of a particular project
