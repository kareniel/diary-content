## dispatch in ngredux

replace bound actions with dispatch function. it's slightly more verbose 
but way less confusing. also reduces the surface area of the component.
do it while keeping the binding with the `connect` function, and only
remove it when every action call has been replaced. this way we can avoid
breaking stuff inadvertently.
```javascript
// before
import actions from './actions'
const disconnect = $ngRedux.connect(state => ({
  ...state
}), actions)
this.someaction(arg)

// after
import actions from './actions'
const dispatch = $ngRedux.dispatch
const disconnect = $ngRedux.connect(state => ({
  ...state
}))
dispatch(actions.someaction(arg))
```

## async effects workflow in ngredux

calculate data that is derived from a particular side effect (http call for example) 
in the action creator that gets executed when the side effect returns.

ie: 
```javascript
// component.js
import {received} from './actions'
service.fetchData().then(response => dispatch(receive(response)))

// service.js
fetchData = () => 
  dispatch => 
    Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      dispatch({type: fetched })
      fetch('/api', {}).then(response => resolve(response))
    
// actions.js
export function receive (res) {
  // do something with res here
  const transformed = res
  return {
    type: received, 
    payload: { data: transformed } 
  }
}
```
