### things i considered working on

- ui kit for the choo ecosystem [(trainkit)](https://github.com/kareniel/trainkit)
- bitsy tools to make game making more fun
  - specing out and documenting the format
  - a dialog system with decision trees
  - walking paths for sprites
  - events (inspired by rpgmaker, but much more simple)
  - a custom full-screen ui
    - auth w github & load/save game data in a git repo
- a bitsy game [(orb-bitsy-data)](https://github.com/kareniel/orb-bitsy-data)
- a browser extension that automates clicking on the links in download gates for you and downloads the file in the background
